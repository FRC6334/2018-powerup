# Team 6334 - Aluminati

Team 6334's 2018 FRC bot source code.

Read this:
- You are __**NOT**__ to replicate or use this code without proper permission from a ranking team member.
- More to come.
- You are to branch off of **master** if you're making a module/something that doesn't affect main bot code.
- You are to make a **merge request** proposing to merge your branch into **development**! Merge requests going to the master branch will be redirected to the **development** branch.
- Do **NOT** directly commit to either the master or development unless it's an EMERGENCY! Please instead make a new branch off of master or development, and merge request it back into development.
- You MUST install CTRE Talon SRX firmware, and wpilib to gain full functionality with this code.
Styleguide info will be established later, along with proper merge request formatting.
